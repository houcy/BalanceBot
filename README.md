## Welcome to the BalanceBot homepage

This project is part of the class MEC8358: Mechatronics II at Polytechnique Montreal. It's part of the mechatronics orientation for mechanical engineering students. The goal of the project is to understand how to build and design a mechatronic system, notably in the choice of system parameters, dynamic system modelling, motor control, PID tuning, and microcontroller programming.

Two-wheel balancing robots have become quite popular in the past few years, so we will be borrowing our ideas from previous projects and research papers. You can find links to videos and research papers on balance robots [here](references).

### Project Components

The BalanceBot feedback loop will consist of actuators, sensors, a microcontroller and other control circuitry. It will also need a support structure and other components. You can find links to the actual parts I bought as well as explanations for my choices [here](components). Here's a preliminary list of required parts:

- Geared DC motors
- Wheel assembly
- Motor drivers
- Battery
- Microcontrollers
- Acceleromoeter/gyroscope combo
- Support structure
- Wires etc

Most of these parts, are/were purchased from [RobotShop](https://www.robotshop.com).

### Under Construction

This website is still being set up, so lots of things are still tutorial text.

Markdown tips:

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/vashmata/BalanceBot/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
