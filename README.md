## Welcome to the BalanceBot homepage

This project is part of the class 8358: Mechatronics II at Polytechnique Montreal. It's part of the mechatronics orientation for mechanical engineering students.

### Project Components

The BalanceBot needs a structure, actuators, sensors, a microcontroller and other control circuitry, as well as a battery.

Wheels, support structure, Arduino microcontroller, geared DC motors, motor drivers, battery, acceleromoeter/gyroscope combo, wires etc... If we want to get even more interesting, we could get a microcontroller with wifi capabilities and develop an app or use a controller or something.

Most of these parts, if not all, will be purchased from [RobotShop](https://robotshop.com).
