- [Acceleromoeter/gyroscope combo](https://www.amazon.ca/Robojax-MPU-6050-Gyroscope-Accelerometer-Raspberry/dp/B079Z1W6NS/): I'm not sure exactly where I bought this from, but the picture's the same. This is an MPU-6050 accelerometer-gyroscope combo. It has 6 axes (3 for gyro, 3 for accel), and I'm currently using a Kalman filter to combine the data and give me the angle of the board.
